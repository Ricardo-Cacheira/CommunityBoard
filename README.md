# Community Board

University project for the second semester of the Games and Apps course in IADE.

Community Board is a website that aims to facilitate communication among residents of the same apartment complex or neighborhood. In it users can post requests for help (e.g. older resident needs a ride to the super market) and other users can volunteer to help.


First experience using node.js and some web frameworks and libraries (e.g. vue.js, socket.io)
